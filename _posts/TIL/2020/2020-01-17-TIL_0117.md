# Process of Assembly Line Schedule  in  Recursion

## Assembly Line Scheduling

- ![200117](/assets/post_img/20200117-1.png)
- DP 를 이용한 예제
- 어느쪽 라인으로 보낼때 상품이 더 빨리 나오는지?

### 결과

![200117](/assets/post_img/20200117-2.png)

- Line 1  에서 최소 시간 38초가  걸림
- 38초 걸리게 하기 위해서 어떻게 station 을 따라가야하는지는 오른쪽 테이블을참고해야함

## Recursion 방법 코드

```python
# Process of Assembly Line Scheduling 
class AssebmlyLinesInRecursion:
    time_station = [[7,9,3,4,8,4],
                    [8,5,6,4,5,7]]
    time_belt = [[2,2,3,1,3,4,3],
                    [4,2,1,2,2,1,2]]
    count = 0
    def scheduling(self, idx_line, idx_station):
        print(f'calculate scheduling: line - {idx_line}',
                f'station - {idx_station}, count - {self.count}')
        self.count += 1
        
        # excape loop         
        if idx_station == 0:
            if idx_line == 1:
                return self.time_belt[0][0] + self.time_station[0][0]
            elif idx_line == 2:
                return self.time_belt[1][0] + self.time_station[1][0]
        
        # recursion         
        if idx_line == 1:
            cost_line1 = self.scheduling(1, idx_station-1) + self.time_station[0][idx_station]
            cost_line2 = self.scheduling(2, idx_station-1) + self.time_station[0][idx_station] + self.time_belt[1][idx_station]
            
        elif idx_line == 2:
            cost_line1 = self.scheduling(1, idx_station-1) + self.time_station[1][idx_station] + self.time_belt[0][idx_station]
            cost_line2 = self.scheduling(2, idx_station-1) + self.time_station[1][idx_station] 
        
        if cost_line1 > cost_line2:
            return cost_line2
        else: 
            return cost_line1
    
    def start_scheduling(self):
        num_station = len(self.time_station[0])
        
        # 마지막 time_belt 는 따로 더해줌
        cost_line1 = self.scheduling(1, num_station-1) + self.time_belt[0][num_station]
        cost_line2 = self.scheduling(2, num_station-1) + self.time_belt[1][num_station]
        
        if cost_line1 > cost_line2:
            return cost_line2
        
        else:
            return cost_line1
```
